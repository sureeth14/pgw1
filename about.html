  Millions of children are dying every day from hunger and diseases that are made worse by undernutrition.
  No child should ever go hungry or suffer from preventable sickness and disease because their basic nutritional needs go unmet.
  The statistics are discouraging, but Feed Godâ€™s Hungry Children knows that even the smallest gift of compassion can change lives one child at a time.
  You can make a difference in the world and give hope to these hopeless children.
  Please consider supporting the good work of TSF'S Hungry children today, and you can know that you will be part of a much better tomorrow.
  TSF's Hungry Children reaches out to hurting children and their families all over the world by providing food, clothing, and spiritual education.
  You can be a part of helping and healing these forgotten and hurting children.
